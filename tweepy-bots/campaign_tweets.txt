#Ethiopia has effectively served three terms in #UNSC (1967-68, 1989-90, 2017-18) & significantly contributed towards the success of #UNSC PKOs in Sudan & Somalia; thus, being a reliable partner, not a threat. #EthiopiaPrevails @Chinamission2un @franceonu @RussiaUN
#TPLF facilitated conflicts in & among #HOA states, leading #HOA to further fragility& instability. #Ethiopia’s effort to stop #TPLF from posing further challenge should be supported, not sanctioned. #EthiopiaPrevails @Chinamission2un @franceonu @RussiaUN @UKUN_NewYork
#TPLF armed millions of civilians & publicly called for a violence against #ENDF. Its special forces & militias fought w/o their military uniforms pretending as civilians. @amnesty claims such armed fighters are civilians. #EthiopiaPrevails @Chinamission2un @RussiaUN

The TPLF regime & its ideology are the main causes of the problems we are witnessing in #Ethiopia now. Understanding this cause is vital in tackling the problems. TPLF is gone, but vanishing its toxic ideology needs more effort. #UNSCActNow to support #Ethiopia in this
#UNSC should be cognizant of both overt & covert misinformation against #Ethiopia's law enforcement operation in Tigray by the #TPLFCriminals that uses the money it embezzled from #Ethiopia for 27 yrs. #EthiopiaPrevails @Chinamission2un @franceonu @RussiaUN @UKUN_NewYork

Colonialism was the rule of the past, no nation will abrogate its God-Given right to help its people by its own resource. Ethiopia's proposal is to share! Ethiopia is not denying water for #Egypt and #Sudan. #FillTheDam @_AfricanUnion @Presidence_RDC @StateDept #UnityForEthiopia
We Ethiopians are ready to use the #River Nile, our #Abay with our neighbors! Empty threats, rumors of war, and machinations of Egypt are nuisances. Unproductive! #FillTheDam @_AfricanUnion @Presidence_RDC @StateDept @EACC_EAN #UnityForEthiopia
We must use the #Nile equitably without blackmail, guns, and cyber threats. #Egypt must understand that the 120 million people need the #GERD for electricity as #Egypt needs the Nile water for its agriculture and 90% of its electricity. #FillTheDam #UnityForEthiopia
War and conflict over Nile Water harm the region. Perpetual enmity is not the answer. A harmonious relationship must be the common goal. #FillTheDam @_AfricanUnion @Presidence_RDC @StateDept @EACC_EAN @SudanTribune_EN @SudanzUprising #UnityForEthiopia
