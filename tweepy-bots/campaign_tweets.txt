#Egypt's policies have undermined every efforts to broker an agreement on #GERD. This includes the AU-led process that launched in June 2020. #Ethiopia remains committed to reaching a fair and balanced agreement on the #GERD. #GERDis4Development
#GRED will bring electricity, industry, commerce etc. to millions of Africans, thus developing the economy expanding access to health & education & improving the quality of life for millions of people across the horn of Africa!! #GERDis4Development…
It is raining in Ethiopia.We love it when it rains, especially when it fills the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.Whether Egypt, Sudan, their western & Arab allies like it or not, the rain keeps raining. Oh yes, it fills our dam. #GERDis4Development…
257 million people in east #Africa are relying on #Ethiopia to show strong leadership, which means striking a fair deal. Technical issues have been resolved  time to get the GERD deal done before filling it with Nile River water! #GERDis4Development…

#GRED will benefit Sudan & Egypt by retaining a lot of silt & sedimentation, the world indeed needs to appreciate the number of benefits GRED brings to Sudan & Egypt. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @USUN @UN @antonioguterres @RussiaUN
#GRED creates an artificial lake the size of London then the water flows through a pipe to the turbines to create electricity and it continues its flows to Sudan & Egypt. So the dam will not reduce water from the downstream countries. #GERDis4Development

The reality on the ground about the GERD is that it has zero influence on water flow to downstream countries because it is electric dam, not irrigation. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @RussiaUN @MOFAVietNam @NDeRiviere @irishmissionun @USUN @UKUN_NewYork
The United Nations Security Council has said that the dispute between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, regarding the Grand Renaissance Dam project (GERD), is outside the scope of its work #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @MOFAVietNam @NDeRiviere @irishmissionun
The UNSC by allowing its respected platform to discuss Ethiopia's electric dam twice, it clearly shows to the world how its values, statue and acceptance has been degraded. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @PassySolomon @MarrietS @EstoniaUN @IndiaUNNewYork

What lengthens the negotiations on the dam is that #Egypt insists on upholding the 1959 Colonial Agreement, which gave it control over what is not its property and 100% of the Abbay's water. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @KenyaMissionUN @nazaninemoshiri
