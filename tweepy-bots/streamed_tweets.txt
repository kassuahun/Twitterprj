2021-05-17 03:13:09.330023 @ChathamHouse holding a webinar on Ethiopian election with panelists representing one-sided perspectives will not constitute a debate.

2021-05-31 03:27:02.753358 An assertion like ‘the widening political gulf between Oromia and Amhara’ comes from ignorance of the political situation in Ethiopia. It does not mean there are no extremists with intent to destabilise.  @SenateForeign @JimInhofe @latimes #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:17:26.259693 The SFRC hearing is on US strategic & geopolitical interest but nothing else. All these human rights issues in Tigray are a cover-up & bogus. Some senators stated about China, Russia & Turkey around #HOA too. It is not about humanity! @SFRCdems @SenatorMenendez #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:17:58.143503 The West is not about democracy at all! For 30 years TPLF made a mockery of democracy in Ethiopia. It 'won' 5 elections! The US and EU blessed all these elections! The June 2021 election will be better than any Ethiopia has had so far! #ForwardElectionEthiopia #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:33:00.086458 The Whitehouse statement says’ The United States urges Ethiopia’s leaders and institutions to promote reconciliation, human rights, and respect for pluralism’ Yes! They are doing so! Help them not sanction them!  @SenateForeign @JimInhofe @EU_Commission @latimes #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:33:32.033505 SR97 says: 'Whereas, in the early hours of November 4, 2020, Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military offensive' But it totally glosses over TPLF's sneak attack upon z Federal soldiers first! Where on earth is treason forgiven?  @UN @AUC_MoussaFaki @SenateForeign #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:34:03.984126 There has never been, there is none now & there will never be an Amhara-Tigray land conflict! History had demarcated the 2 regions. People have intermarried, moved in between z regions & even fought 4 powers, but not over land issues until TPLF came. @JimInhofe #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:59:10.479741 RESPECT Ethiopia. RESPECT Eritrea. RESPECT Africa. It all begins with treating small or poor nations as equals and worthy of RESPECT. #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 13:59:42.326208 Ethiopia existed as a state for thousands of years. No one will teach Ethiopia|ns how to govern itself |themselves! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:00:14.142635 There is no dearer term to #Ethiopia|ns than #Independence and #Freedom. #Ethiopia’s Sovereignty is not up for negotiation! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:00:45.943174 Ethiopia definitely fought colonialism. It will not kneel down for neo-colonialism. Stop interfering in Ethiopia’s Sovereignty! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:01:17.879076 Ethiopia is a leading contributor of African solutions to Africa’s problems. It can’t be patronized by neocolonialist proponents! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:01:49.779132 Democratic nations should support, not deter Ethiopia|ns transition to Democracy. #USA, #EU, not practicing what you teach is HYPOCRISY! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:02:21.711245 As the Founder and Home of the African Union, Ethiopian sovereignty is immensely important to AU member states. #Stop interfering in Ethiopia’s internal matters! #HandsOffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:02:53.741984 The US/EU’s audacity to dictate the withdrawal of Amhara forces and the cancellation of the national election undermines int’l law & the etiquettes of int’l diplomacy. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:03:25.709751 The US should be circumspect in its foreign policy approach towards/against Ethiopia, the sole proAmerican state & public in the terror ravaged & yet geopolitically significant HOA. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:18:27.628436 Europe’s incessant objection to @AbiyAhmedAli’s political reform & the completion of GERD is inspired by its deep seated neocolonial to dominate and exploit Africa. #Africa4Ethiopia #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:18:59.690109 The reprehensible position of the western powers is severely threatening the core of our country Ethiopia. Our differences shouldn’t be our weakest links. We shall join hands to say #HandsoffEthiopia. #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:19:31.546264 The World has not seen the much-touted peace dividend following the end of the cold war. Instead, it got Al Qaeda, ISIS, AL Shabab, Boko Haram, TPLF, OLF Shene, & one failed state after another. It's Enough! #HandsOffEthiopia! #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:20:03.504875 US unprincipled, biased and misguided foreign policy and sanctimonious posture towards Ethiopia disgracefully disregards the sovereignty of Ethiopia & the century old partnership b/n ET & US. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:35:36.128489 Dictating & micromanaging Ethiopia’s internal matter is against the int’l principle of sovereignty and equality of states in the performance of int’l r/ns & affairs. Ethiopia is a sovereign nation, and will remain so. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:36:09.989060 The west should not be threatened by Ethiopia’s path to ecopolitical independence under @AbiyAhmedAli’s leadership, nor should it meddle in the internal affairs of the country for its proxy geoeconomic/political rivalry against China & Russia. #HandsoffEthiopia… @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:36:41.879543 @SecBlinken @SFCdems ill-advised position is perceived as colluding with #TPLF #terror syndicate & extremist ethnic-nationalists vowing to destabilize #Ethiopia. It is igniting nationalism & hostility towards the #US, considered a great friend by z people at large @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:38:39.966596 Prospect of Ethiopia’s ecopolitical success is a ray of light 4 Africa, a continent that was mostly decolonised & united under one organisation (OAU) through the pioneering effort of Ethiopia’s Haile Selassie I. #Africa4Ethiopia #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo
