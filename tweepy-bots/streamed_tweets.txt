2021-05-17 03:13:09.330023 @ChathamHouse holding a webinar on Ethiopian election with panelists representing one-sided perspectives will not constitute a debate.

2021-05-31 03:27:02.753358 An assertion like ‘the widening political gulf between Oromia and Amhara’ comes from ignorance of the political situation in Ethiopia. It does not mean there are no extremists with intent to destabilise.  @SenateForeign @JimInhofe @latimes #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:17:58.143503 The West is not about democracy at all! For 30 years TPLF made a mockery of democracy in Ethiopia. It 'won' 5 elections! The US and EU blessed all these elections! The June 2021 election will be better than any Ethiopia has had so far! #ForwardElectionEthiopia #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:33:00.086458 The Whitehouse statement says’ The United States urges Ethiopia’s leaders and institutions to promote reconciliation, human rights, and respect for pluralism’ Yes!

2021-05-31 13:33:32.033505 SR97 says: 'Whereas, in the early hours of November 4, 2020, Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military offensive' But it totally glosses over TPLF's sneak attack upon z Federal soldiers first! Where on earth is treason forgiven?  @UN @AUC_MoussaFaki @SenateForeign #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 13:34:03.984126 There has never been, there is none now & there will never be an Amhara-Tigray land conflict! History had demarcated the 2 regions. People have intermarried, moved in between z regions & even fought 4 powers, but not over land issues until TPLF came. @JimInhofe #HandsoffEthiopia

2021-05-31 14:02:53.741984 The US/EU’s audacity to dictate the withdrawal of Amhara forces and the cancellation of the national election undermines int’l law & the etiquettes of int’l diplomacy. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:03:25.709751 The US should be circumspect in its foreign policy approach towards/against Ethiopia, the sole proAmerican state & public in the terror ravaged & yet geopolitically significant HOA. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:18:27.628436 Europe’s incessant objection to @AbiyAhmedAli’s political reform & the completion of GERD is inspired by its deep seated neocolonial to dominate and exploit Africa. #Africa4Ethiopia #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:18:59.690109 The reprehensible position of the western powers is severely threatening the core of our country Ethiopia. Our differences shouldn’t be our weakest links. We shall join hands to say #HandsoffEthiopia. #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:19:31.546264 The World has not seen the much-touted peace dividend following the end of the cold war. Instead, it got Al Qaeda, ISIS, AL Shabab, Boko Haram, TPLF, OLF Shene, & one failed state after another. It's Enough! #HandsOffEthiopia! #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 14:20:03.504875 US unprincipled, biased and misguided foreign policy and sanctimonious posture towards Ethiopia disgracefully disregards the sovereignty of Ethiopia & the century old partnership b/n ET & US. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:35:36.128489 Dictating & micromanaging Ethiopia’s internal matter is against the int’l principle of sovereignty and equality of states in the performance of int’l r/ns & affairs. Ethiopia is a sovereign nation, and will remain so. #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:36:09.989060 The west should not be threatened by Ethiopia’s path to ecopolitical independence under @AbiyAhmedAli’s leadership, nor should it meddle in the internal affairs of the country for its proxy geoeconomic/political rivalry against China & Russia. #HandsoffEthiopia… @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:36:41.879543 @SecBlinken @SFCdems ill-advised position is perceived as colluding with #TPLF #terror syndicate & extremist ethnic-nationalists vowing to destabilize #Ethiopia. It is igniting nationalism & hostility towards the #US, considered a great friend by z people at large @usembassyoslo

2021-05-31 15:38:39.966596 Prospect of Ethiopia’s ecopolitical success is a ray of light 4 Africa, a continent that was mostly decolonised & united under one organisation (OAU) through the pioneering effort of Ethiopia’s Haile Selassie I. #Africa4Ethiopia #HandsoffEthiopia #EthiopiaPrevails @usembassyoslo

2021-06-25 21:28:17.351869 Undoubtedly, @Haavisto|'s self-assured confidence to claim nuanced understanding of z country, people, current circumstances from his visits to Ethiopia is flawed and i smacks of a colonial mindset that still lurks. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:30:00.237651 Ethiopia rejects hostile statements of @Haavisto ‘lack of ceasefire implementation’: which ignors ignores repeated calls by z gov #TPLF to lay down arms & seek amnesty.

2021-06-25 21:30:59.852518 @Haavisto gave testimony @Europarl_EN insinuating that highest leadership of a sovereign country shared with him, they want to ‘wipe out the Tigrayans for 100 years’ is a complete fabrication, utterly irresponsible, outrageous and undiplomatic. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:32:14.524415 ‘inability of farmers to cultivate in the agricultural season’@Haavisto fails to acknowledge the works of gov & int. partners like @FAO, to prepare farmers for the upcoming planting season through distribution of fertilizers, seeds & agro equipment. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:33:27.191432 The allegations made by @Haavisto in his briefing are clear indications of the underlying desire by the Special Envoy to undermine the Ethiopian gov and try to facilitate unwarranted interventions through disinformation and outrageous lies. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:34:17.860493 Ethiopian gov rejects hostile statements of @Haavisto : ‘for talks with the Tigray opposition’: #TPLF is not considered as opposition in Tigray; it is a group declared as terrorist by the parlament in a constitutional process. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:36:02.496986 Ethiopian gov rejects hostile statements of @Haavisto ‘So called elections’: as millions of Ethiopians go to the polls, belittling this democratic process which ensures the will and aspirations of Ethiopians is unwarranted. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:36:44.122361 It is unfortunate that @haavisto being peddled under the pretense of humanitarian concern for Tigray but what is glaringly apparent is a colonial overtone and superiority that Ethiopian will never accept. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:38:38.752631 Z claims by @Haavisto that "senior Ethiopian leaders expressed desire to destroy Tigray" is a hallucination of sorts or a lapse in memory of some kind. Its a shamles lie at big position. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-06-25 21:40:19.452317 The Ethiopian government rejects the briefing by @Haavisto to the European Parliament on 15 June 2021 in relation to his visits to Ethiopia as a Special Envoy of the European Union. https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchCpL7OOy1BK58forhg3vEaPQYQbktPElOCWXQkBmZOtwkmxrcWGthB9X_GzV01W6qHjMyjvLyR9g/pub

2021-07-07 18:35:00.425833 According to the 1997 United Nations Convention on, Article 9 provides for regular exchange of information.

2021-07-07 19:11:49.526393 The reality on the ground about the GERD is that it has zero influence on water flow to downstream countries because it is electric dam, not irrigation. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @RussiaUN @MOFAVietNam @NDeRiviere @irishmissionun @USUN @UKUN_NewYork

2021-07-07 19:13:38.531672 The United Nations Security Council has said that the dispute between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, regarding the Grand Renaissance Dam project (GERD), is outside the scope of its work #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @MOFAVietNam @NDeRiviere @irishmissionun

2021-07-07 19:16:11.543472 The UNSC by allowing its respected platform to discuss Ethiopia's electric dam twice, it clearly shows to the world how its values, statue and acceptance has been degraded. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @PassySolomon @MarrietS @EstoniaUN @IndiaUNNewYork

2021-07-07 19:18:41.579694 Today we showed the world that the dam is ours....and we are the only one who can decide on it.

2021-07-07 19:20:20.587547 What lengthens the negotiations on the dam is that #Egypt insists on upholding the 1959 Colonial Agreement, which gave it control over what is not its property and 100% of the Abbay's water. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @KenyaMissionUN @nazaninemoshiri

2021-07-07 19:23:20.602727 #Egypt and #Sudan attempt to internationalize GERD is unacceptable. #Ethiopia believes that #AU led mediation will solve it. #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @nazaninemoshiri @PassySolomon @MarrietS @EstoniaUN @IndiaUNNewYork @MexOnu @NorwayUN @TunisieDiplo

2021-07-07 19:53:10.595633 #GRED does not consume water, which means the flow of the water to the downstream countries never stops; if #UN is as passionate enough for the wellbeing of human lives on earth #UN should support #GRED for changing millions of lives  #GERDis4Development @NorwayUN @USUN @UN

2021-07-07 19:55:58.609666 Ethiopia is building GERD for producing electricity only. But Will build a lot of other dam for agriculture, for drinking and for our cattle to drink.

2021-07-07 19:58:00.632694 Filling the GERD-dam means having a light bulb in every house in Ethiopia, not having a gun, why are westerners saying it is a security issue? #GERDis4Development #RespectEthiopianSovereignity @UKUN_NewYork @KenyaMissionUN @nazaninemoshiri @PassySolomon @MarrietS @EstoniaUN
